It can incorporate the entire journey of a product, from its initial conception and production, storage, distribution, retail, and finally delivered to the place of consumption. In essence, the supply chain is the backbone of global commerce, facilitating the movement of goods through its various stages, across many geographical locations.</p> <p>Globalization has significantly transformed the landscape of supply chains, expanding their reach but also increasing their complexity. Companies now source materials and components from diverse global locations to capitalize on cost advantages and specialized regional capabilities. While this is beneficial for cost optimization, it also exposes supply chains to various risks, such as geopolitical uncertainties, natural disasters, and other disruptions.</p> <p>The below diagram demonstrates a simple version of a supply chain. The units of goods moved through the supply chain are either shipments or consolidations.</p> <p>Shipment:  A shipment typically represents a booking by the supplier with a freight forwarder. It normally comprises goods for the same buyer and may cover one or more purchases.</p> <p>Consolidation/Consol: A consolidation, sometimes called a consol, is a collection of shipments. Typically, a consol represents the carrier\u2019s view of the transaction.</p> <p>It is broadly divided into three phases:</p> <ul> <li>Procurement</li> <li>Export</li> <li>Import</li> </ul> <p>Each phase involves a series of activities between suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and retailers, all aimed at optimizing efficiency and minimizing costs.</p> <p>Figure 1: The diagram depicts a simple goods movement transaction through the supply chain.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Industry%20Foundation/User%20Guide/2TheSupplyChain/#procurement","title":"Procurement","text":"<p>This typically involves purchasing goods and services.

In this scenario, the Sub-Master Bill is treated as a House Bill issued from freight forwarder \u2018A\u2019 to freight forwarder \u2018B\u2019, whereas the issued bill is treated as a Master Bill when used by Freight forwarder \u2018B\u2019 (who will subsequently issue House Bills to their own clients).</li> </ul> <p>The Master Bill is the parent bill for the House Bills. Understanding this hierarchy of Bills is pivotal, especially when managing consolidated shipments through freight forwarders and coordinating with various stakeholders in the transport process.
