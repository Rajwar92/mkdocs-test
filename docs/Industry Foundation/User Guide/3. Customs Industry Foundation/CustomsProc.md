# Customs Procedures

Customs procedures involve several steps, each designed to ensure international trade transactions' legality, accuracy, and compliance.

The following are common customs procedures:

+ [Pre-Loading Documentation](#pre-loading-documentation)
+ [Pre-Arrival Documentation](#pre-arrival-documentation)
+ [Customs Declaration and Examination](#customs-declaration-and-examination)
+ [Duties and Taxes Assessment](#duties-and-taxes-assessment)
+ [Release of Goods](#release-of-goods)
+ [Post-Clearance Audit](#post-clearance-audit)

## Pre-Loading Documentation

The carrier or their agent (e.g., customs broker, freight forwarder, or an NVOCC acting on behalf of the carrier) submits all the required documentation to customs before loading the goods onto the conveyance. This allows customs authorities to perform initial checks and risk assessments before the goods leave the origin for their jurisdiction. Goods at this time may be deemed high-risk and denied permission to load onto the conveyance, thereby mitigating any risks or complications before the goods enter their jurisdiction.

## Pre-Arrival Documentation

Importers and exporters, carriers, or their agents, submit the final versions of all the required documentation to customs before the arrival of the goods. This allows customs authorities to perform initial checks and assessments. Unlike the pre-loading submission, the purpose of this pre-arrival process is to notify the customs authorities of an impending arrival and begin the customs clearance import process. This also allows the authorities to commence assessing the goods for compliance with regulations, duties, and taxes.

> ***Note:*** *Some jurisdictions mandate that the pre-arrival documents be submitted electronically no later than a predetermined time, such as 48 hours for sea cargo and 4 hours for air cargo.*

## Customs Declaration and Examination

Importers/Exporters or their customs broker submit a customs declaration, providing comprehensive details about the goods. This declaration process links to the pre-arrival details and crystallizes the risk assessment and compliance with regulations, duties, and taxes. Customs officials may examine the goods physically or through advanced screening technologies before they are cleared to proceed to their next destination.

## Duties and Taxes Assessment

Applicable duties and taxes based on the declared value and other relevant factors are required for customs clearance. This assessment determines the financial obligations of the importer and/or exporter, depending on the agreed terms of the transaction as stated in the Incoterms.

## Release of Goods

Once all requirements are met, customs issue a release order, allowing the goods to be transported to their final destination. This may involve the issuance of a customs clearance certificate.

## Post-Clearance Audit

Customs may conduct audits after the release of goods to ensure ongoing compliance. This can include documentation reviews and financial records related to the import or export.
