# ASYCUDA

The Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) is a computerized customs management system that covers most foreign trade procedures. The system was designed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to administer a country’s customs.

ASYCUDA is used in over 100 countries and territories around the world. Most of these are categorized as developing or less than developing countries or territories. ASYCUDA provides these countries and territories with all the required computerization to efficiently manage their revenue and regulatory requirements.

The objective of ASYCUDA is to provide the same rich features as many of the developed countries’ authorities at a low cost. The system handles manifest, customs declarations, risk assessment, accounting procedures, warehousing, and suspense procedures. It also provides the administration with detailed statistics about their foreign trade transactions, which can be used for analysis and planning.

The system adheres to all international standards relevant to customs processing as established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), World Customs Organization (WCO), and United Nations (UN).
