# Customs in Supply Chain
Customs plays a pivotal role in the supply chain, serving as a regulatory authority responsible for controlling the flow of goods across national and regional borders.

Its existence is rooted in several key purposes, the primary ones being:

+ [Border Security](#border-security)
+ [Trade Regulation and Compliance](#trade-regulation-and-compliance)
+ [Revenue Collection](#revenue-collection)
+ [Statistical Analysis](#statistical-analysis)

## Border Security

Customs acts as a frontline defense mechanism, ensuring the security of a country or regionâ€™s borders by inspecting goods entering or leaving the territory. This involves the detection of illicit substances, dangerous materials, or prohibited items that could pose a threat to national security.

## Trade Regulation and Compliance

Customs authorities regulate international trade by enforcing import and export regulations. They ensure that businesses comply with trade laws, tariffs, and trade agreements. This function is critical for maintaining fair trade practices and protecting domestic industries.

## Revenue Collection

Customs agencies collect duties, taxes, and fees on imported goods. This revenue is essential for funding government activities, infrastructure development, and public services. Customs valuations and classifications determine the applicable tariffs and taxes.

## Statistical Analysis

Customs processes generate data on the volume and nature of trade activities. This information aids in the formulation of economic policies, trade strategies, and trade balance monitoring.
