# Key Actors in the Supply Chain

The supply chain is a complex network involving multiple key actors, each playing a crucial role in ensuring the smooth flow of goods from production to consumption. Let's explore the responsibilities of these key actors and the potential consequences if any of them were to disappear from the supply chain.

The following are the key actors in the Supply Chain:

+ [Consignee (Receiver/Importer)](#consignee-receiverimporter)
+ [Consignor (Shipper/Exporter)](#consignor-shipperexporter)
+ [Carriers (Road/Rail/Sea/Air/Other)](#carriers-roadrailseaairother)
+ [Freight Forwarders](#freight-forwarders)
+ [Transport Hubs](#transport-hubs)
+ [Customs Brokers](#customs-brokers)
+ [Customs and Government Departments](#customs-and-government-departments)
+ [Warehouses and Distribution Centers](#warehouses-and-distribution-centers)
+ [Local Carriers](#local-carriers)

## Consignee (Receiver/Importer)
The consignee is the recipient of the goods. This can be a retailer, distributor, or the final consumer (buyer). The consignee's role is to receive and utilize the products. The consignee is also often the initiator of the supply chain activity. If consignees were absent, there would simply be no demand for goods, disrupting the entire supply chain and rendering production and transportation processes futile.

## Consignor (Shipper/Exporter)
The consignor—usually the manufacturer, supplier, seller, retailer, wholesaler, distributor, or producer—initiates the supply chain by creating or procuring the goods or products. Their role involves manufacturing or procuring, packaging, and labeling products for transportation. If consignors were to disappear, there would be a fundamental breakdown in the supply chain, as there would be no goods to move or distribute.

## Carriers (Road/Rail/Sea/Air/Other)
The carrier—usually the shipping line, airline, courier, transport operator, rail operator, energy company, or trucking company—facilitates the transportation. The transportation process may include many carriers, but the main or primary carrier is the international carrier. Transportation is a critical link in the supply chain, involving the physical movement of goods between different locations. If carriers were to disappear, goods would remain stuck at the manufacturing or storage locations, leading to inventory pileups, production halts, and shortages in the market.

Vessel operating common carriers (VOCCs)—also known as shipping lines, shipping companies or ocean carriers—own and operate their own vessel fleet. They typically also own the shipping containers and sell port-to-port freight services. VOCCs tend to work with full container loads, bulk (grain or liquids), or break bulk (specialized items such as cars, livestock, or items too large to be containerized). If VOCCs were to disappear, bulk and large goods would not be able to travel between continents, resulting in shortages in the market and greater expenses.

## Freight Forwarders
Freight forwarders coordinate and facilitate the transportation of goods. They manage the logistics, arrange shipping, and handle documentation. If freight forwarders were to disappear, coordinating shipments would be chaotic, leading to delays, increased costs, and potential losses as goods would struggle to reach their intended destinations efficiently.

Non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCCs) are typically freight forwarders or agents for the carrier tasked with on-selling space on vessels. They provide ocean transport services without owning or operating any vessels or containers, and normally also provide freight services beyond the port-to-port. NVOCCs will hire a container from the VOCC and consolidate many shipments to fill the container, before passing the container to the VOCC for transportation to the destination port. If NVOCCs were to disappear, there would be chaos in coordinating shipments, leading to delays, increased costs, and potential losses as goods would struggle to reach their intended destination efficiently.

## Transport Hubs
Transport hubs, such as Waterway Ports, Air terminals, and Container yards serve as key hubs for transferring goods between different modes of transportation, such as ships/planes/trains and trucks. They play a vital role in facilitating international trade. If ports and terminals were to disappear, the seamless transfer of goods between different transportation modes would be disrupted, causing significant delays, increased costs, and hindering global trade.

## Customs Brokers
Customs Brokers are specialized agents or entities that facilitate the clearance of goods through the customs processes. The customs brokerage or agency typically consists of many professionals who are specialists in their area of customs compliance. They act as intermediaries between the importer or exporter and customs authorities, ensuring all necessary documentation is complete, accurate, and compliant with local customs regulations. Customs Brokers help navigate the complexities of international trade, including tariff classifications, duty payments, and compliance with import/export restrictions. If Customs Brokers were to disappear, the customs clearance process would become challenging for businesses with delays at borders, increased risk of regulatory non-compliance, and potential fines.

## Customs and Government Departments
Government departments, particularly Customs, regulate and oversee the movement of goods across borders. The Customs Department ensures compliance with import and export regulations, maintains security, and collects duties and taxes. If customs and government departments were to disappear, the risk of smuggling and illegal trade would increase, the lack of regulation could lead to safety and security concerns in the supply chain, and, the duties imposed to protect some local industries would be circumvented leading to a distortion of the economic landscape, potentially impacting domestic industries and trade dynamics.

## Warehouses and Distribution Centers
Warehouses and distribution centers serve distinct roles within the supply chain. Warehouses are facilities designed for the storage of goods, providing a location where products can be stored for an extended period. Distribution Centers are strategically positioned facilities focused on efficiently distributing goods to consumers directly or via retailers. They are equipped to handle the sorting, packing, and transporting of products to their final destinations.

Some warehouses, known as customs-controlled warehouses, have an additional function. These facilities are authorized by customs authorities to store goods under specific conditions, deferring duty or tax liability until the goods are released for sale or further distribution. This allows businesses to optimize cash flow and manage their financial obligations more effectively within the customs framework.

If Warehouses and Distribution Centers were to disappear, this would disrupt the storage, handling, and distribution of goods, impacting the overall efficiency of the supply chain. Additionally, the absence of customs-controlled warehouses would eliminate a valuable tool for managing duty and tax liabilities, affecting the financial dynamics of businesses engaged in international trade. The interconnectedness of these elements underscores the importance of these facilities in maintaining a well-functioning and responsive supply chain.

## Local Carriers
Local carriers refer to transportation providers operating within specific regions or countries. They play a crucial role in last-mile delivery, transporting goods from distribution centers or warehouses to the final destination, such as retail stores or directly to consumers. Local carriers may include trucking companies, couriers, or other regional transportation services. If local carriers were to disappear, the timely and efficient delivery of goods to end-users would be compromised. This could result in goods piling up at suppliers, warehouses, and distribution centers, causing significantly delayed shipments, increased warehousing fees to businesses, and negatively impacting customer satisfaction.
