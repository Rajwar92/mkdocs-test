# Overview

The Foundational Guide for Customs contains the following chapters: 

+ [Industry Foundation](<Industry Foundation/IntroIndustry.md>): Industry content focuses on the logistics industry separate from WiseTech and CargoWise. It covers industry terminology and outlines the context in which we operate and the needs we fill.

+ [Product Foundation](<Product Foundation/IntroProd.md>): Product content focuses on the product we offer to our clients in the industry (i.e., CargoWise in the case of Customs). It dovetails with Industry content by explicitly addressing industry challenges and how we operate in the industry context. It also dovetails with Technical content in that what is possible and what is practical to develop as part of our product is, in part, determined by how the product is built.

+ [Technical Foundation](<Technical Foundation/IntroTech.md>): Technical content focuses on the software that makes our product a reality. Technical content has some sections that are intended to be understood by both product people and developers (to facilitate collaboration), and other sections that are only intended for developers, including specific programming instructions. Which section is which is clearly marked.
