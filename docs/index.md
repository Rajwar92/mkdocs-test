# Introduction to Blume

Blume is the only multi-tenant holistic transportation management system with end-to-end visibility, supply chain orchestration and execution solution in the market. Blume solutions are designed and built as cloud-native SaaS. Blume's competitors have grown through acquisitions and therefore must integrate disparate products to deliver the same level of functionality. Blume's ecosystem has an existing and organically growing network of over 10,000 logistics providers worldwide curated over the past 26+ years. All logistics providers are available to all network participants enabling fast time to value.

Blume uniquely generates and manages data required to plan, execute and track shipments, accurately estimate arrival times (ETA) and process invoices enabling orchestration across trading partners, automation and optimization. Blume competitors must develop integrations to access this same data, extending deployment time and creating delays in real-time data access. Blume has built a unique IP which enables the company to utilize a combination of real-time data feeds and 26+ years of historical data for prediction, forecasting and optimization.

Like Google Waze, Blume's network density and real-time data feeds enables correlation of data to more accurately predict ETA's and other events which can impact shipments. At best, competing visibility solutions display when there is an issue, while Blume enables customers to take action to resolve issues. Blume provides a lower total cost of ownership.
