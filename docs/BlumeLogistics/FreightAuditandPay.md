# Freight Audit and Pay

repository, rating management and validation, machine learning-driven invoicing, cost accrual auditing and
blockchain-enabled payment and settlement.

Blumeâ€™s Freight Audit and Pay solution consists of the following features:

One of the biggest challenges for all supply chain participants is gaining financial clarity into the

manual, paper-based auditing and reconciliation process, which is often inaccurate and expensive. Blume
